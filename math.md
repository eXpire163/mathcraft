prompt

I want to build a game from my youth that helped me to train math. Esspecially the 101 in multiplacation, so in a arange from 1x1 to 10x10.

The idea is to build a basic p5.js based game that :
- shows an equasion like "5x15 ="
- reads numbad keyboard input to solve the quation
- if correct it gives you 1 point
- if incorrect you look one of you lives (lets start with 5 lives)
- you only have 5 seconds while under 20 points, 4 seconds under 40 points and then only 3 seconds to solve
- if you don't solve it within that time you loose also one live
- if need some kind on indicator on how mutch time is left (maybe a bar fills under the equation)
- i want a HUB that show the current points, the amount of lives left in form of hearts.
- the game should start when hitting space bar
- when you lose the game should show the final points. and the info to press space to start a new game.
- when hitting space a new round should start and set current points back to 0 and points live back to 5

- please add a TODO section for later ideas like a highscore tracking system, sound effects. some anymations etc.

try to keep it simple and clean


prompt 2

i love it. But it feels anoying to press enter after each number. can you find a way without it

prompt 3

now feels more fluent, nice.

Next i need an indicator if it was correct or not
Please show the equation in green if it was correct and in red if it was false. lets for 0.7 seconds before going to the next on.
Also the window is currently very small. can you adjust it to the current window size?

prompt 4

ok, this is fun!!! but i needs some audio effects. can you generate a success and fail sound like on the old video consoles NES or so that plays on success or fail of the quastion?

prompt 5

oh no, i don't get the audio yet. but i get the error
The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page. https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#web_audio
value @ p5.sound.min.js:2Understand this warning

prompt 6

cool audio works now.
I could imagine that having only one melody might get boring pretty soon. can you add 8 more success sounds please and play them in random order?

I found a bug, when running out of time i loose all lives at ones (or maybe one per frame, not really clear). i should only loose one live and see the normal incorrect feedback and then go to the next equastion

Prompt 7

Lets work on the design. I have mindcraft in mind. So Starting with a gras green background via timebar made out of mindcraft stones. Also adjust the style of all texts to the new mindcraft theme. If you don't find images that could be usefull. insert some placeholders and i try to find some.

the timebar could also be a creaper that runs towards you and you can defend it with the correct answer and show it as a shooting arrow. just as an idea.
